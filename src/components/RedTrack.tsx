/**
 * RedTrack attribution tag, verbatim from the affiliate network.
 *
 * What it does: reads `rtkcid` from the landing URL, or asks
 * `app.auralyapp.com/{rtkcmpid}` for a fresh click id when the ad did not carry
 * one, then writes it to the `rtkclickid-store` cookie for 30 days. That cookie
 * is the whole point — `lib/checkout.ts` reads it at click time and appends it
 * to the checkout URL, which is what credits the sale to this affiliate. It also
 * forwards the Meta `_fbp`/`_fbc` cookies as `sub19`/`sub20` and boots Meta's
 * CAPI param builder.
 *
 * `beforeInteractive` so the tag runs during HTML parse rather than after React
 * hydrates. The cookie has minutes to be written before anyone reaches the
 * paywall, so the timing is not tight — but the network call is fired from a
 * 50ms timer inside the tag, and a visitor who bounces off the landing page
 * should still be attributed.
 *
 * The body is the network's own code: it is their contract, not ours, and
 * reformatting it would make future snippet updates a diff to reconcile instead
 * of a paste. It is served inline rather than from a file because it must not
 * wait on a second round trip.
 *
 * One deliberate restoration: `reportView` below. The network's hosted tag
 * (app.auralyapp.com/track.js) calls `/view?clickid=` after writing the cookie
 * and this transcription had dropped it, which is why the affiliate dashboard
 * counted clicks with a bare zero next to them under View Quiz.
 *
 * This file covers the two columns that land on arrival — Clicks, from the
 * `?format=json` call that mints the id, and View Quiz, from `reportView`. The
 * other three are fired from the funnel itself: Starquiz and Endquiz through
 * `app.auralyapp.com/postback` in lib/tracking.ts, and Checkout through the
 * `/click` hop in lib/checkout.ts. Between them every column of that dashboard
 * is reached. (The producer's own funnel fires Starquiz and Endquiz as Facebook
 * and Bing pixel events instead; the postback endpoint is the pixel-free route
 * to the same two rows.)
 *
 * One dependency worth knowing about: the Meta CAPI builder is pulled from
 * unpkg.com at runtime. It loads `async` and every call is wrapped in
 * try/catch, so an in-app browser that blocks it degrades quietly and RedTrack
 * attribution still works — only Meta's CAPI enrichment is lost.
