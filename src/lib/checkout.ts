 * read at click time are the only channels that survive the jump.
 *
 * Why the URL is assembled at click time rather than rendered into an `<a href>`:
 * the producer's own funnel renders a bare link and lets a RedTrack script sweep
 * the DOM afterwards to graft the click id onto it. That works on a static page
 * and is fragile here — any React re-render replaces the mutated node with the
 * original href, and the sale silently loses its attribution. Reading the cookie
 * inside the handler means the id is fetched at the instant it is needed, and no
 * re-render can undo it.

 * is what records the checkout step against the click; a URL assembled on our
 * side alone never touches their servers, which is why that step stayed at zero
 * while clicks did not.
 *
 * It drops `email` and `FIRSTNAME`: send them and the Location comes back
 * without them. So the hop is made as a background fetch rather than a
 * navigation — the response's final URL is readable from here (their CORS
 * allows it), and the visitor fields are appended to it afterwards. That keeps
